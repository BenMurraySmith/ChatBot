# ChatBot

This project delivers a UI to interact with Meta's Llama3.1 8B LLM. The interface is built in Streamlit which manages the state of the application, and I use Langchain to send and receive messages to LLama3.1 through Ollama. 

To use this application, you will need download Ollama, pull through the llama3.1 model and ensure you have at least 8 GB of RAM available.
